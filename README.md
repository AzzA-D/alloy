**Alloy** is a starting point - the begining of a boilerplate and pattern library for all! Using HTML5 and LESS for building both small and large scaleable websites.

## Upcoming features

* **Grids** - more grids than you can shake a stick at, with systems that work for varying viewport sizes
* **LESS** - base styles, mixins and patterns using atomic theory
* **Templates** - templates & patterns constructed with handlebars to help you start quickly
* **Grunt** - the system will use grunt to do a lot of the legwork and compilation of your static site

So much to do and what a fun journey it will be :)

## Reference

This whole project is based and influenced by many boilerplates and helpers from around the web. I will try to include a full list here for reference.
