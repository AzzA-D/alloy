# Alloy v0.0.0

**Alloy** is a starting point - the begining of 

A boilerplate and pattern library for all! Using HTML5 and LESS for building both small and large scaleable websites.

## Upcoming features

* **Grids** - more grids than you can shave a stick at, with systems that work for varying viewport siszes.
* **LESS** - base styles, mixins and patterns using the atom, molecule & organism theory.
* **Templates** - templates & patterns constructed with handlebars to help you start quickly. 
* **Grunt** - the system will use grunt to do a lot of the legwork and compilation of your static site.

So much to do and what a fun journey it will be :)

## Reference

This whole project is based on many boilerplates and helpers from around the web. I will try to include a full list here for reference.
